# YNAWB
A proof-of-concept web-based portal for viewing your YNAB budgets. I thought it would be fun to attempt to mimic the desktop version of YNAB and see if I could adapt it for the web. That being said, I mostly wanted to add the ability for this to be a viewer into your YNAB budgets, not so much the ability to edit them. My main motivation  for this being I really, ***really*** don't want to screw up your budgets. Another motivation is that I don't intend for this to be feature complete in any sense of the word or for it to ever see any traffic other than myself and a couple other people. The YNAB team is working on a  web-based SASS service so give them your business when it's ready (they deserve it!). I just thought this would be a fun exercise.
